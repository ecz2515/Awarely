# iPhone 16 Build Configuration

This project should always target iPhone 16 for builds and development. The main configuration is in [Awarely.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj](mdc:Awarely.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj).

## Key Settings to Maintain:
- **Deployment Target**: iOS 18.5 (supports iPhone 16)
- **Targeted Device Family**: "1" (iPhone only) - currently set to "1,2" (iPhone + iPad)
- **Platform**: iOS

## Build Commands:
When building or running the project, always use iPhone 16 simulator:
```bash
# Build for iPhone 16
xcodebuild -project Awarely.xcodeproj -scheme Awarely -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16'

# Run in iPhone 16 simulator
xcodebuild -project Awarely.xcodeproj -scheme Awarely -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16' build
```

## Xcode Configuration:
- Set the active scheme to target iPhone 16
- Ensure the deployment target remains at iOS 18.5 or higher
- Consider updating TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY to "1" for iPhone-only builds

## Testing:
All UI tests and development should be conducted on iPhone 16 simulator to ensure proper layout and functionality for the target device.
